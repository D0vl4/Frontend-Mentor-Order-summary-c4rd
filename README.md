### What I learned

Biggest problem was the ability to round up the top corners of the svg illustration. First, I tried on the html page, but I couldn't figure it out. Then I switched to CSS with an URL and set the border-radius. It seems super easy, but I got stuck for some time at that point and I am very proud I figure it out ðŸ™‚

This is the CSS property for the illustration:

```css
background-image: url("images/illustration-hero.svg");
width: 100%;
height: 220px;
border-radius: 20px 20px 0 0;
```
